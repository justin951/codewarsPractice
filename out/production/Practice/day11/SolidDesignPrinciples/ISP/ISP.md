Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
ISP states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that interfaces should be small and focused, and clients should only depend on the interfaces they need. To apply ISP in Java, you should aim to create interfaces that are small and focused. This means that you should avoid creating large, general-purpose interfaces that are used by many clients. Instead, you should create multiple small interfaces that are each focused on a specific set of functionality. Clients can then depend on only the interfaces they need.
