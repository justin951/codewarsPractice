Real World Application for the SOLID topic
In the following section, we will describe how each SOLID principle can be used in real world applications:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
In a web application, a User class should handle user-specific operations such as authentication and authorization, while a separate EmailService class should handle sending emails. ISP ensures that each class should be responsible for specific functionality and this separation ensures that changes to the email functionality won't affect the user-related operations.

Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
Consider a payment system where new payment methods can be added. By leveraging OCP, rather than modifying the existing code, the system can define an interface called PaymentProcessor and have multiple classes implementing it, such as CreditCardProcessor and PayPalProcessor. This way, new payment processors can be added without modifying existing code.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
In a banking application with different account types like SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount inheriting from the base class Account, LSP ensures that code expecting an Account object can seamlessly work with any subclass object. Regardless of the specific account type, LSP guarantees that common functionalities like depositing and withdrawing funds, as well as any shared behaviors defined in the base class, remain consistent.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
If we apply ISP to a messaging system, instead of having a single IMessage interface with multiple methods like SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, and DeleteMessage, separate interfaces like ISender and IReceiver can be created. Clients can then implement the interfaces that correspond to their specific needs.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
In an e-commerce application, instead of the OrderProcessor class depending directly on a specific payment gateway implementation, it can depend on an IPaymentGateway interface. Adherence to DIP would allow for easier switching between different payment gateway providers without impacting the core logic of the application.
