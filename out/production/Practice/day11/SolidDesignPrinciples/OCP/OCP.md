Open / Closed Principle (OCP)
OCP states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a system without modifying its existing code. To apply OCP in Java, you should aim to design classes that are open for extension but closed for modification. This can be achieved by using interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism. For example, instead of modifying an existing class to add new functionality, you could create a new class that implements the same interface and provides the new functionality.
