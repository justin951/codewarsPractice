Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
LSP states that subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. This means that any instance of a base class should be able to be replaced by an instance of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. To apply LSP in Java, you should aim to create subclasses that can be used in place of their superclass. This means that the subclass should not change the behavior of the superclass. For example, if you have a Bird class and a Penguin subclass, you should ensure that the Penguin class does not change the behavior of the Bird class.
